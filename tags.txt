The first six fields from “ACSSF” to “0000001” are identifiers:
1) The first field tells you that this is an ACS Summary File
2) The second tells you that these data are five year estimates for the year 2005 2009 (notice the “e” before “2009” and the “5” at the end)
3) The third tells you the state, e.g.. “ak” is Alaska
4) The fourth is an iteration number 000
5) The fifth is the sequence number 0003
6) The last is a logical record code LOGRECNO 0000001. Use LOGRECNO to determine the geographic area within a state.

Then use the geography file for Alaska to determine the location within the state to which the data refer. 
The appropriate file is g20095ak.txt, where “g” stands for geography, “2009” is the year, 
“5” is the period estimate (in this case, 5 year estimate), and “ak” is the state. The
geography file, g20095ak.txt, defines the LOGRECNO. Each LOGRECNO in this file specifies a geographic area pertaining
to the state. For example, a LOGRECNO of “0000001” means the state of Alaska; a LOGRECNO of “0000002” means just the urban areas in Alaska; a
LOGRECNO of “0000003” refers to just rural areas in Alaska. (Each state geography file also contains the lower
case FIPS State Code.) Please be aware that each state has its own geography
file. For more information, see
Chapter 2.4
